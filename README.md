Sample json request

There are 2 application files here, 1 data file and a web page to test the request.

 * data.csv contains 2 records in csv format to give a datasource
 * DataReader.php configures our datasource and searches for the specified information
 * info.php receives, validates and processes the json request
 * index.php is a simple web page that provides 2 links to make and display requests using jQuery
 
 The request may also be called by hand.
